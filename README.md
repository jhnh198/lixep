Web Design Project for CS 321

read at least some of this http://www.git-tower.com/learn/ebook/command-line/basics/what-is-version-control#start
and this before submitting code. 
1: When uploading code, put your name in the title and in first a first line comment of the pages you're working on
2: Put the date after your name 
3: Provide a brief explanation of what your code does, or attempts to do with commits/branches
4: Place known bug notes, including features that don't work or are not implemented. 
5: Finally, make sure that your code is as complete as possible before commiting to the group repo. 
Work in your local repo until the code is ready. 
6: If you want help, try to only ask for one item that needs to be improved. make sure you note the areas that do not work.
If multiple issues occur from the one, try to rework your implementation and make the issues less/not dependant (coupled)
to each other. If there are still more problems, then it is okay to ask for a solution to these issues.
